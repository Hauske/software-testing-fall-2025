3. Function that calculates the discount for a customer's purchase based on the total amount.
The discount rules are as follows:

def calc_discount(x):
    return discount

If the total amount is less than 100, no discount is applied.

x == 99.9999.... No discount

If the total amount is between 100 and 500 (inclusive), a 10% discount is applied.

x == 100 10% discount
x == 500 10% discount

If the total amount is greater than 500, a 20% discount is applied.

x == 500.0000001..... 20% discount
x == 9999999......... 20% discount
